 I've been learning, doing, and explaining technology professionally since 1995. In the past year or so, I've gotten more interested in analyzing and explaining things using data. I worked through the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate and other similar certificate programs offered through Coursera, and took courses in SQL, Scientific Python, and advanced Excel analysis at Austn Community College.

 Right now, I'm looking for a job where I can apply my new data analysis and Python skills. I've put together a few [projects](/projects) that demonstrate the things I've learned in the past couple of years.
