<h2 id="aboutTMandDCP">About Toastmasters and the Distinguished Club Program</h2>
<h3 id="TM_clubs_and_districts">Toastmasters Clubs and Districts</h3>
<a href="https://www.toastmasters.org/About">Toastmasters International</a> is the well-known
<blockquote>
“...nonprofit educational organization that teaches public speaking and leadership skills through a worldwide network of clubs.”
</blockquote>
<p>Toastmasters clubs exist all over the world. Most Toastmasters clubs are grouped into districts, with as few as 29 and as many as 292 clubs 
  per district. There are currently 126 districts numbered from 1 to 126, plus the <strong>Founder’s District</strong> 
  (designated <strong>District F</strong>), which is located in California where Toastmasters was founded in 1924. </p>

<p>Districts are subdivided into divisions and areas.</p>

<p>New clubs created in locations that are not in one of the geographical districts are grouped as <strong>District U</strong> (“U” as in “Undistricted”). 
  When enough new clubs are created in an undistricted location, the clubs can apply to form a new numbered district.</p>

<p>Almost all clubs worldwide meet in person, and many also accept members who join online using Zoom, Google Meet, or Microsoft Teams. 
  There are a few clubs that only meet online, with members from all over the world. 
  These online-only clubs are grouped in Division O (for “Online”) and are part of District U.</p>

<p>Districts are also grouped into geographical regions. There is a <a href="https://www.toastmasters.org/resources/region-and-district-map">map 
  showing Regions and Districts</a> on the Toastmasters website.</p>

<h3 id="DCP">The Distinguished Club Program</h3>
<p>Toastmasters International promotes the “Distinguished Club Program” (DCP) as a way for clubs to be recognized for success in meeting KPIs 
  in the Toastmasters education program. The DCP is an annual program, starting on July 1 and ending on June 30 of the following year. 
  Clubs achieve goals in the DCP by having their members complete levels in Pathways (the Toastmasters educational program), recruiting new members, 
  having the club officers attend biannual officer training, and by submitting officer lists and member renewals on time.</p>

<p>Toastmasters publishes current and historical Distinguished Club Program statistics for each District on the
   <a href="https://dashboards.toastmasters.org">Dashboards page</a>. For example, the current Club Performance statistics for District 55 
   (which includes Austin, San Antonio, and other parts of south Texas) can be seen at
   <a href="https://dashboards.toastmasters.org/Club.aspx?id=55">https://dashboards.toastmasters.org/Club.aspx?id=55</a></p>

<h3 id="DCPdashboards">The Distinguished Club Program Dashboards</h3>
<h4 id="dashboards_Home">Dashboards Home page</h4>
The <a href="http://dashboards.toastmasters.org">home page</a> of the Distinguished Club Program (DCP) dashboards shows the current alignment of Districts
 into Regions, and has drop-down controls to (a) select the District, (b) select the program year (from 2008-2009 through the current year),
  (c) month (July through June), (d) “As of” date for each month, and (e) a link to Export a CSV file of the data:
<img src="/assets/images/tm/DCP_home_page.png" alt="Toastmasters Distinguished Club Program (DCP) home page header">

<h4 id="district_perf_page">District Performance page</h4>
Selecting a district from the first drop-down takes you to the District Performance page showing membership statistics for that district. 
For example, the summary page for the Founder’s District (District F) for the current program year is at:  
<a href="http://dashboards.toastmasters.org/district.aspx?id=F&hideclub=1">http://dashboards.toastmasters.org/district.aspx?id=F&hideclub=1</a>

There are three tabs on the District Performance page:
<img src="/assets/images/tm/DistrictPerformanceTab.png" alt="Toastmasters DCP District Performance tab">

<h4 id="club_perf_page">Club Performance page</h4>
Selecting the Club Performance tab takes you to a page showing a table of the DCP statistics for all the clubs of the district:  
<img src="/assets/images/tm/ClubPerformanceTab.png" alt="Toastmasters DCP Club Perforamnce tab">

<h4 id="club_details_page">Club Details page</h4>
Finally, clicking on one of the club numbers in the first column will take you to a page showing the details for that club:  
<img src="/assets/images/tm/DCP_club_status_page.png" alt="Toastmasters DCP status page for Toastmasters club number one">

<h4 id="HTTP_GET">HTTP GET Method</h4>
The Club Performance pages for the district and individual clubs are retrieved using HTML GET requests, so each page can be retrieved by creating a URL with program year, district, and month parameters. For example, the year-end (June) data for the 2021-2022 program year for District F can be retrieved at:  
<a href="http://dashboards.toastmasters.org/2021-2022/Club.aspx?id=F&month=6">
http://dashboards.toastmasters.org/2021-2022/Club.aspx?id=F&month=6</a>

<h4 id="export_CSV">EXPORT CSV link</h4>
Like the home page, each District Club Performance or Club Status page contains a drop-down control to download the page data as a CSV file:  
<img src="/assets/images/tm/ClubPerformance_with_CSV_dropdown.png" alt="Club Performance tab showing CSV Export drop-down">

The CSV download can be chosen using Selenium browser automation, but there is no obvious way to create a URL to download the CSV data directly.

<h2 id="scraping_the_data">Scraping the Club Performance Data</h2>
<h3 id="using_Selenium">Retrieving data using Selenium browser automation</h3>

<p>I first tried to retrieve Toastmasters club performance data using Selenium in Python.</p> 

<p>My first script was named <code><a href="">scrapeTM.py</a></code> and did the following:
<ol>
<li>Get the target Toastmasters program year (e.g. ‘2021-2022’) if one was supplied on the command line</li>
<li>Create a Selenium webdriver object for the Firefox web browser</li>
<li>Used the webdriver object to navigate to the dashboards home page</li>
<li>If a program year was supplied on the command line, make sure there’s a corresponding subdirectory in the local harddrive</li>
<li>If a program year was supplied, the webdriver selects the program year from the drop-down control, otherwise use the default (current) program year</li>
<li>Since the number of districts is not static from year to year, retrieve the list of available districts from the District drop-down control.</li>
<li>For each district:
  <ol type="a">
    <li>Use the webdriver object to navigate to the District Performance page</li>
    <li>If the program year was supplied, choose month 6 (June) to get the year-end data</li>
    <li>Use the webdriver object to click on the Club Performance tab</li>
    <li>Use the webdriver object to click the “CSV” dropdown to download the “Club_Performance.csv” to the Firefox default download directory</li>
    <li>Wait a few seconds, then rename the “Club_Performance.csv” with the district ID and program year, and move it to the subdirectory in the local harddrive</li>
  </ol> 
</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>I used this script to retrieve the year-end data for the most recent program year (2021-2022), then tried earlier program years. There was a problem on the Toastmasters website for the four earliest years, but I was able to retrieve the more recent years.</p>

<p>I realized there were four problems with my script:
  <ul>
    <li>Each district’s data was in a separate CSV file, so I would need to combine multiple files into a single CSV for each program year in order to get useful insights.</li>
    <li>The last row of each CSV was a short row containing “Month of Jun” in column A, and “As of 03/28/2023” (the date I retrieved the CSV) in column B. This would need to be removed before importing the CSV into SQLite or another database.</li>
    <li>Each data row included the District ID number or letter in Column A, but did not contain the program year or month.</li>
    <li>The script was <strong>SLOW</strong> - it took nearly 40 minutes to retrieve the June (year-end) data for 125 districts for a single program year.</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>Problems 1, 2, and 3 could have been fixed in step 7(e), but the slowness was a dealbreaker.</p>

<h3 id="retrieving_and_extracting">Retrieving data with urllib.request and Beautiful Soup</h3>
<h4 id="urllib_request">Retrieving the data using urllib.request</h4>
<p>I started over and created two new scripts.</p>
<p>The first new script, <code><a href="">Get_TM_monthly_Club_Perf_HTML.py</a></code>: 
  <ol>
    <li>Reads a program year and optional list of months from the command line</li>
    <li>If the list of months wasn’t specified on the command line, set the list of months to ('7','8','9','10','11','12','1','2','3','4','5','6')</li>
    <li>Creates the output <code>./HTML</code> subdirectory if it doesn’t exist</li>
    <li>Creates the output <code>./HTML/{program year}</code> subdirectory if it doesn’t exist</li>
    <li>For each month:</li>
    <ol type="a">
      <li>Create the output <code>./HTML/{program year}/{month}</code> subdirectory if it doesn’t exist</li>
      <li>Use <code>urllib.request</code> to get the HTML for the Founder’s District (district “F”) Club Performance page</li>
      <li>Analyze the page HTML using the Python ‘Beautiful Soup’ library to get the list of available districts from the “Select a district” drop-down control</li>
      <li>Reverse the list of districts so it counts down from “U”, “F” … “02”, “01”</li>
      <li>Retrieve the page HTML for each district’s Club Performance page <br>
        (e.g. <a href="http://dashboards.toastmasters.org/2022-2023/Club.aspx?id=F">http://dashboards.toastmasters.org/2022-2023/Club.aspx?id=F</a> )<br>
        using <code>urllib.request</code> and store the HTML as:<br>
        <code>./HTML/{program year}/{month}/{district}.html</code></li>
      <li>Pause for 0 - 3 seconds</li>
    </ol>
  </ol>
  <p>This script was less than 100 lines long, and took only 15 minutes to retrieve the HTML for 125 districts for 12 months of one program year, 
    compared to 40 minutes to retrieve and analyze the data for a single month of one program year with my first script.</p>
    
<h4 id="BeautifulSoup">Extracting the data with BeautifulSoup</h4>
  <p>
    The second new script, <code><a href="">Extract_Club_data_from_HTML.py</a></code>:
    <ol>
      <li>Gets a directory or file name as a command line parameter</li>
      <li>If the input was a file name, 
        <ol type="a">
          <li>Verify that the last parts of the file path are like:<br>
            <code>…/{program year}/{month #}/{district ID}.ext</code></li>
          <li>Create a new output CSV file like:<br>
            <code>./CSVs/{program year}_{month #}_{district ID}.csv</code><br>
            and write a CSV header line to the file
          </li>
          <li>Extract the Distinguished Club Program data from the input file as a Python list</li>
          <li>Append the district ID, list of DCP data, program year, and month number to the output CSV file</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>If the input parameter was a valid directory and ends in:
        <code>…/{program year}/{month #}</code>
        <ol type="a">
          <li>Create a new output CSV file like:<br>
            <code>./CSVs/{program year}_{month #}.csv</code><br>
            and write a CSV header line to the file</li>
          <li>For each file in <code>…/{program year}/{month #}</code> : 
            <ol type="i">
              <li>Extract the district ID from the file name</li>
              <li>Extract the DCP data from the file contents as a Python list</li>
              <li>Append the district ID, list of DCP data, program year, and month number to the output CSV file</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>If the input parameter was a valid directory that ends in <code>…/{program year}</code>:
        <ol type="a">
          <li>Create a new output CSV file like:<br>
            <code>./CSVs/{program year}.csv</code><br>
            and write a CSV header line to the file</li>
          <li>Use the Python os.walk function to recursively retrieve the HTML files from the subdirectories of the input directory</li>
          <li>For each file in each month’s subdirectory:
            <ol type="i">
              <li>Extract the district ID from the file name</li>
              <li>Extract the DCP data from the file as a Python list</li>
              <li>Append the district ID, DCP data, program year, and month number to the output CSV file</li>
            </ol>  
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </p>
</p>
<p>To test this script, I created a TEST directory, created a couple of subdirectories for program years ‘2012-2013’ and ‘2022-2023’,  
  created some month subdirectories in each program year directory, and copied a few of the HTML files that had been downloaded 
  by the Get_TM_monthly_Club_Perf_HTML.py script. </p>
  <p>I then ran the second script on the TEST data:</p>
<code>python .\Extract_Club_data_from_HTML.py  .\TEST\2012-2013\</code>
<p>The script ran and processed all the .html files in <code>.\TEST\2012-2013</code>. 
  I tried the script with the files in <code>.\TEST\2022-2023</code>, and it also worked with this TEST set.</p>

<h4 id="first_production_run">The First Production Run</h4>
<p>Since the test runs had succeeded in processing all the individual files in the monthly subdirectories for the two program years in the TEST directory,
  I tried running the script against all the downloaded .html files for the earliest program year, 2008-2009:</p>

<code>python .\Extract_Club_data_from_HTML.py .\HTML\2008-2009\</code>

<p>The script ran with no apparent problems, and I spot-checked a few clubs against the data in dashboards.toastmasters.org. 
  Everything checked out, so I created a pipeline in Windows PowerShell to process the remaining years:</p>

<code>$program_years = Get-Childitem .\HTML -Name | Where-Object {$_ -ne ‘2008-2009’}
  $program_years | ForEach-Object {python .\Extract_Club_data_from_HTML.py “.\HTML\$_” }</code>

<p>Everything ran with no problems. I started spot checking data from 2009-2010 using Microsoft Excel, and continued with 2010-2011, 2011-2012, etc. </p>
<p>Everything was fine until 2016-2017. Where is District U?</p>

<h4 id="District_U_is_Missing">District U is Missing</h4>
<p>I looked at the June (year-end) District Performance page for District U:</p>
<a href="http://dashboards.toastmasters.org/2016-2017/district.aspx?id=U&month=6"><img src="/assets/images/tm/DistrictU_DistPerf_tab_2016.png" alt="Toastmasters District U 2016 District Performance dashboard"></a>
<p>Everything looked fine, so I clicked on the Club Performance tab:</p>
<a href="http://dashboards.toastmasters.org/2016-2017/error.aspx?aspxerrorpath=/2016-2017/Club.aspx">
  <img src="/assets/images/tm/ClubPerf_AnErrorHasOccured.png" alt="Toastmasters District U 2016 Club Performance dashboard error message"></a>
<p>I added a check to look for this error text (<em>An error has occured please report this</em>) in the source HTML file and when found, log the program year, month, 
  and district to a text file.   I then re-ran Extract_Club_data_from_HTML.py for all the HTML files I had. </p>
<p>Looking at the log file, I found that District U was missing in program years 2016-2017, 2017-2018, 2018-2019, and 2019-2020.
   In addition, District 102 was missing in 2016-2017.</p>

<h4 id="Find_missing_Club_Perf_data">Getting the missing Club Performance data</h4>
<p>I spot-checked a few of the District U months from the problem years listed in my new log file, and confirmed that the Club Performance pages
   all showed the “An error has occured” [sic] message.</p>
<p>I checked the District Performance pages for the problem months and years, and saw that the page had links to the clubs in the district:</p>
<img src="/assets/images/tm/DistrictU_DistPerf_tab_2016_excerpt.png" alt="detail of Toastmasters District U 2016 District Performance page">
<p>I followed a couple of links, and verified that the missing information was available on each club’s Club Status page for that month and program year:</p>
<a href="http://dashboards.toastmasters.org/2016-2017/ClubReport.aspx?id=03182108 ">
  <img src="/assets/images/tm/June2016ClubStatusPageClubNumber03182108.png" alt="Toastmasters Club number 03182108 Club Status page for June 2016"></a>

  <h4 id="alternate_script">Retrieving individual club data and storing it in SQLite</h4>
  <p>I created a new script, alt_Get_and_extract_TM_monthly_Club_Perf_data.py, to </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Read the program year, month, and district from the script’s command line</li>
    <li>Create a new SQLite database file or connect to an existing database for the program year and district</li>
    <li>Create a club_performance table in the database</li>
    <li>Get the list of individual clubs from the District Performance page for a given district, program year, and month.</li>
    <li>For each club:
      <ol type="a">
        <li>Retrieve a saved copy of the Club Status page, or download the page (and save a copy to the hard drive)</li>
        <li>Extract the club’s DCP data using Beautiful Soup</li>
        <li>Save the DCP data to the SQLite database</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>I’ve written SQL queries against existing databases at work and in online tutorials, but this was my first experience with creating a database 
    and saving data from a Python script. It worked so well, I found myself almost wishing I’d used SQLite instead of writing to CSV files
     in the previous script (Extract_Club_data_from_HTML.py). 
     However, CSV files are more portable, since they can be imported into Excel as well as SQL databases.</p>
<h4 id="wrapping_up">Wrapping Up</h4>
<p>I exported the District U and District 102 from the SQLite databases to CSV files, and then I used PowerShell to append these files to the other 
  districts’ data in 2016-2017.csv, 2017-2018.csv, 2018-2019.csv, and 2019-2020.csv. </p>
<h3 id="making_data_available">Making the data publicly available in Google Cloud Storage</h3>
<p>Since Google Cloud Storage allows individuals to store up to 5 GB and transfer up to 100 GB for free every month, I created a Cloud Storage bucket 
  in one of my Google Cloud projects and uploaded copies of the CSV files for each complete program year to the Cloud Storage bucket. The individual 
  CSV files averaged around 22 MB each, and the total was just over 300 MB. All files in Cloud Storage are read-only, so there is no way for anyone to 
  alter the shared CSVs.</p>
  
<p><em>[update December 2023: After Toastmasters closed out the 2022-2023 program year at the end of July 2023, I retrieved the data for the full year 
  and uploaded it to the Cloud Storage bucket, along with fresh copies of the preceding program years. I also imported all 15 CSV files to a single Excel 
  spreadsheet and uploaded a copy to the Cloud Storage bucket.]</em></p>
