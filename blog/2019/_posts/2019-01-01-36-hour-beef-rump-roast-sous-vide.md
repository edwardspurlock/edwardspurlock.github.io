Beef rump roast (\$3.29 / pound), cut to 2.5 inches thick

Seasoned with beef fajita seasoning and beef stock concentrate

Sous vide cooked for about 36 hours at 130 degrees

Verdict:  
36 hours was too long - the consistency was very soft, "like pat√©" as my wife said.

Next time: a good cut, but try it at 24 hours (like the usual shoulder cut) instead of 36
