In my role as tech support for Google Maps APIs, I've become interested in Android development.





Here are some links I've found and want to save:





-   [Google Developers Training for Android](https://developers.google.com/training/android/), including the following:
-   [Android Developer Fundamentals (Version 2)](https://developer.android.com/courses/fundamentals-training/overview-v2)
-   [Kotlin Bootcamp for Programmers](https://www.udacity.com/course/kotlin-bootcamp-for-programmers--ud9011)
-   [Build Native Mobile Apps with Flutter](https://www.udacity.com/course/build-native-mobile-apps-with-flutter--ud905)
