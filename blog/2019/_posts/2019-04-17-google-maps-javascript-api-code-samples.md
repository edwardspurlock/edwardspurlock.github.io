I've been working with the Google Maps JavaScript API every work day since last October, but for some reason I only recently noticed the [Code Samples](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/) tab in the online documentation. It looks like a good place for an aspiring web developer to spend some quality time.
