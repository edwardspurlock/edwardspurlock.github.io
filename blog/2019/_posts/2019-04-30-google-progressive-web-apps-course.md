I don't think I've linked to this before:





[Progressive Web Apps Training](https://developers.google.com/web/ilt/pwa/)





This is not a Google technologies course - or not exclusively Google technologies, at any rate. For example, the material on [Push Notifications](https://developers.google.com/web/ilt/pwa/introduction-to-push-notifications) links to Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) API references.
