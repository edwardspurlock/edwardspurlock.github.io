## Mashable:





[Google Maps is the new search destination](http://﻿https://mashable.com/article/google-maps-business-search)  





>   
>  Since the beginning of 2018, the search engine said there's been a 50 percent increase in "Near Me" searches. Also, we're searching for descriptions rather than a specific experience. So "late-night cocktails on a roof" is more common than a specific rooftop bar.
