After my recent rail trip to Michigan, I've been more aware of stories about Amtrak.

I ran acrossÂ an interactive map from the Brookings Institute showing [Amtrak routes, ridership, and profitability](http://www.brookings.edu/research/interactives/2013/AmtrakRoutes "interactive map showing Amtrak routes and ridership"). The takeaways: short routes == full trains, long routes == (nearly) empty trains, full trains make money, and empty trains lose money for Amtrak.

I found the above ridership map from a Slate magazine story on the [Northeast Regional train crash](http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2015/05/13/philadelphia_trainwreck_northeast_regional_crash_shines_light_on_amtrak.html) earlier this week. That's not the only good [Slate story about Amtrak](http://www.slate.com/search.html#search=amtrak), either.

One of the Slate stories (on Amtrak boarding) referenced a story on another site regarding [Amtrak's locomotives](http://observer.com/2013/07/amtraks-fat-expensive-and-slow-new-northeast-corridor-locomotives-arrive-for-testing/ "Amtrak's locomotives are different (heavier)"). They're built heavier than locomotives in other countries (perhaps because American railroads have been dragging their feet on implementing [Positive Train Control](http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2015/05/13/philadelphia_trainwreck_northeast_regional_crash_shines_light_on_amtrak.html "Reasons why we don't have better railroads")).
