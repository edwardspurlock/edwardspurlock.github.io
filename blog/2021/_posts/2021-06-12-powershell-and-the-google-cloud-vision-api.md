I was browsing the document for Google's Cloud Vision API, and I noticed that the "[Detect text in files (PDF/TIFF)](https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs/pdf#powershell)" (OCR) sample can be used with [**curl**]{style="font-family:Courier;"} or [PowerShell]{style="color:white; background-color:blue;"} !!!
