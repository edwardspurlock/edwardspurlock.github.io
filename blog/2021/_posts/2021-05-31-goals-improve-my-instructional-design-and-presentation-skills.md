### Description:





GMP Technical Support Analysts are technical experts - but we're also teachers. A typical tech support interaction involves a customer not only what to do ("Add HTTP referrer restriction") but also why ("...because if you don't, someone could copy your API key"). Also, instructional design and presentation skills come into play when working with other members of the team.





To meet this objective, I propose to review the LinkedIn Learning Path "Become an Instructional Developer" (which I originally completed in January 2020), and complete the "Develop Your Course Design and Instructional Skills" Learning Path.





I have my own LinkedIn Learning subscription, and am not dependent on other resources to complete this objective.
