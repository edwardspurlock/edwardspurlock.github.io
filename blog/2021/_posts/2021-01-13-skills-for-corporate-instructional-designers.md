I'm thinking about changing careers to Instructional Design / Development. As part of my thought process, I wondered what the currently preferred software package is, so I asked a [question in the Instructional Design group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/idesigner/permalink/3715191601835993/) on Facebook.





One response included a set of skills that corporate IDs should know - I wanted to save that set here:





-   consulting
-   storyboarding
-   adult learning theory
-   analysis methods
-   engagement
-   evaluation methods
-   graphic design
-   LMS knowledge





I'm sure I'll find more in the future.
