Another resource I've been mining in the last week or so: [PowerShell.org](http://powershell.org/wp/), an independent community for PowerShell users.

Something at PowerShell.org that you won't find at every other PowerShell resource: the [PowerScripting Podcast](http://powershell.org/wp/category/podcast/), currently on [episode 289](http://powershell.org/wp/2014/11/30/episode-289-powerscripting-podcast-mike-hendrickson-and-jason-walker-from-microsoft-on-configuring-exchange-with-dsc/). AsÂ I get time, I'm paging back through the archives to find episodes that are of interest to me (a relatively new PowerShell user)
