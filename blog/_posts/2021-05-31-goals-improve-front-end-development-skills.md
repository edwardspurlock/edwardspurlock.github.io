**Due Date: 12/31/2021**





### Description:





Supporting GMP APIs requires a solid grounding in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Also, we often see customers developing their websites using the React library.





I propose to upgrade my front end development skills by:





1.  completing LinkedIn Learning Path "Become a Junior WordPress Developer", developing a WordPress child theme (complete by **July 31**), and developing a WordPress theme from scratch (complete by **August 31**)
2.  completing a selection (TBD) of LInkedIn Learning courses in modern (vanilla) JS, and implement a web page enhanced with modern vanilla JavaScript (complete by **October 31**)
3.  complete LInkedIn Learning Paths "Become a React Developer" and "Improve Your React Skills", and implement a web page using React.js (complete by **December 31**)
