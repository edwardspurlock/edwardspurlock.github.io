**Due Date: 7/31/2021**





### Description:





I propose creating a Version 2.0 of the ‘WordPress issues with Google Maps’ resource to document Google Maps-related WordPress plugins and themes. 





This resource would include a schema to show the desired information to include about each plugin, such as.:





-   Theme or plugin Name (required entry)
-   Purpose of the plugin (if not apparent from the name)
-   Is there a free version of the plugin? Premium? 
-   Unify or Vector cases where the plugin was seen in the wild 
-   Link to the plugin’s entry at <https://wordpress.org/plugins/> 
-   Link to the developer’s support page
-   Maps APIs actually required or used (including the endpoints - JS versus web service)
-   Screenshot of the theme’s or plugin’s Maps API configuration in the WordPress dashboard. (this would require setting up the plugin on a test WordPress install, unless a customer’s screenshot from a case is available)
-   Screenshot of the theme’s or plugin’s WordPress configuration under common error conditions (Geocoding or Places API not enabled, Maps JavaScript not enabled, billing disabled, etc)
-   Screenshot of the plugin or theme in use (from a test install)





An additional part of the solution would be a mechanism to nominate new themes or plugins for analysis. This mechanism could be a bug, or could be internal to the document (similar to the “Pending Questions” section of go/maps-tos-faq )





Also, to facilitate multiple contributors, the document should include a “How to contribute” appendix. This appendix could include how-tos for setting up or accessing a test WordPress install,





After creating the document and adding all the plugins and themes in the current ‘WordPress issues with Google Maps’ , I will complete a project one-pager to use the new version in place of the current one.
