Well, boy is my face red. I identified the wrong Google product to use to create chatbots. (also, I'm writing this while getting in a few minutes of exercise on my FitDesk stationary bike).





In my previous post, I identified the Hangouts Chat API as the Google product to build chatbots. Oops. I think that's the product to use to add a chatbot into Hangouts Chat.





No, the correct product to build chatbots is [Google Dialogflow](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow). Dialogflow is where one would build the interactions that could be used in another environment, such as Hangouts.
