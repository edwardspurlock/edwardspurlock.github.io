I've had it.

I've had it with Toastmasters, for the most part.

And I've REALLY had it with some Bernie Sanders supporters.

Those are two things that don't seem to have much logical connection, I know, but there is a connection, at least for me.

I joined Toastmasters about 17 years ago, around this time of the year in 1999. I joined a small club - one that struggled to get enough members to show up at meetings, and one that never really had a consistent mentoring program.

Toastmasters International makes a big deal of mentoring, but from my experience with several clubs, it's an idea that's mostly honored in the breach at the actual club level.

I was one who was not assigned a mentor to guide and inspire me through my first speeches. Despite this, I earned the first level award (the "Competent Toastmaster" or "CTM" award) after 15 months.

It took me more than TEN YEARS (!) after that to earn the next level of speaking award. Ten years to write and deliver ten speeches!
