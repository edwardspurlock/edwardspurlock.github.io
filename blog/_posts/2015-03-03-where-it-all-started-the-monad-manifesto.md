PowerShell originally started as a project called "Monad" within Microsoft.

The original [Monad Manifesto](http://www.jsnover.com/Docs/MonadManifesto.pdf "Monad, the project that became PowerShell")\[PDF\]Â was written by Jeffrey Snover back in August 2002.

BTW, one of the major influences on Monad was a paper by John Ousterhaut:  
[Scripting: HigherLevel Programming for the 21st Century](http://web.stanford.edu/~ouster/cgi-bin/papers/scripting.pdf "John Ousterhaut's 1998 paper on scripting languages - it inspired Monad (which became PowerShell)")\[PDF\]

It's interesting to read Snover's original manifesto and see how much of the original vision made it into PowerShell (and how much didn't).
