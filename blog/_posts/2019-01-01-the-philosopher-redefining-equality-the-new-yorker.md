[The Philosopher Redefining Equality](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/01/07/the-philosopher-redefining-equality) , an article in the latest New Yorker, describes the work of professor Elizabeth Anderson (of the University of Michigan).

I'm still reading the article , but one takeaway for public speaking is Anderson's advice to a new Ph.D worried about giving talks at conferences:

> “Don’t write up,” Anderson advised. “Just do PowerPoint slides.” ... She went on, “Give the big picture, make points to motivate the idea, and punt all the objections to the Q. & A. What ensues is a very lively Q. & A.”
>
> Chuang knitted her brow. An esteemed philosopher at Oxford reads his talks, she said.
>
> “Yeah, horrible,” Anderson said. “So retro.” The issue was that people were afraid of questions, and tried to address them all preëmptively. She laughed darkly: *Hhhh-aahr-aahr-aahr*. “Philosophers are too risk averse, and this makes listening to philosophers *tedious*.”
