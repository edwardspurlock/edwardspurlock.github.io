Microsoft Interface Manager - excuse me, [Windows 1.0 - was introduced to the world on November 10, 1983](http://www.poynter.org/mediawire/top-stories/280131/today-in-media-history-in-1983-bill-gates-and-microsoft-introduced-windows/).

Version 1.0 wasn't actually released to users until 1985, but Bill Gates showed the first version two years earlier at the Plaza Hotel in New York City.

In 1983, I was still trying to be the next great bicycle racer. By late 1985, I'd quit bicycle racing and started to ask myself what I would do next. I decided on electronic music (I should have gone back to college then, instead of waiting a couple of years) and bought my first keyboard (an inexpensive consumer-grade Casio) that year. I bought an Akai AX-80 analog hybrid synth and an Atari ST 520 in 1986, and started getting involved in the local Atari user group.

I bought a Zenith all-in-one PC that ran MS-DOS from floppies in 1988 (1987? 1989?), but I did a lot more with the Atari. My earliest memory of Windows was the announcement of Windows 3.0 in 1990, which happened at the same time as a tech show in Austin where our Atari user group set up a multiplayer MIDI Maze game. (MIDI Maze was an early "first-person shooter" (FPS) game that used the built-in MIDI ports on the Atari ST to network multiple machines)

I didn't actually work on Windows machines until I started work at Dell in 1995. I started training in tech support the week before Windows 95 was released on August 24, 1995 - but I and the other first-level techs in my class didn't get to use Win95 until 1996. My first Windows was Windows 3.1.

Doctor Who fans have a saying - "You always remember your first Doctor." Similarly, I will always remember Windows 3.1 (but not fondly).

Business Insider has a retrospective on [Windows through the years](http://www.businessinsider.com/what-windows-used-to-look-like-2014-11) - that unfortunately neglects to mention Windows NT 3.51, Windows NT 4.0 and Windows 2000. It's as though the first part of my tech career never existed.
