-   Google Places Autocomplete - select a city, then search within that city's bounding rectangle (requires updating the AutocompleteOptions dynamically)
-   Shopping list (PHP backend? Google Cloud? Heroku? Netlify? [Appsheets]{style="text-decoration: underline;"}?)
-   Exercise tracker (PHP / Heroku / GCloud / Netlify backend? [Appsheets?]{style="text-decoration: underline;"})
-   Toastmasters contest ballots (Appsheets)
-   Mixed-mode transportation search - combine Google Maps Platform and CapMetro APIs to find the closest bus route when the start or finish is outside CapMetro's service area.
-   Build a proxy server for Google Maps web service APIs, like Raymond Camden's article on using [Pipedream to build a proxy server for APIs](https://www.raymondcamden.com/2021/06/30/using-pipedream-to-proxy-other-apis). This CSS-Tricks article talks about other ways to [build proxies with serverless functions](https://css-tricks.com/serverless-functions-as-proxies/). Google Cloud AppEngine or Endpoints.
-   Interactive Club Finder for Toastmasters (using Google Dynamic Maps)
-   Pomodoro and other timer as Chrome Extension
-   Google web service API tester (builder/tester?) as Chrome Extension, PowerShell GUI, and/or Electron app
-   Vocabulary flash card-type web app (Firebase/Firestore backend)
-   Re-do my Coursera PHP website using AppEngine Standard PHP backend
-   LinkedIn Learning course "Vanilla JavaScript: Ajax and Fetch", with the Geocoding redone using Google Maps JavaScript API (using API key secured with HTTP referrer restrictions)
-   Web scraping - How many of the top 25 TED talks end with the speaker saying "Thank you"? (see <https://www.facebook.com/groups/ToastmastersInternationalMembers/posts/10158908546323542>/ for motivation)
-   Web scraping - Build a tool in Google Cloud Shell using Python to crawl a web site and look for references to Maps JavaScript API (may need to use a headless browser to access the DOM, rather than the source HTML)
