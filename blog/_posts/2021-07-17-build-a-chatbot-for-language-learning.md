I've been interested in learning languages for most of my life. One thing I struggle with is making the jump from class, book, or app to conversation.





Today I had a thought - what if we used chatbots as a stepping stone between the book/app knowledge and real-world conversations?

I work for Google, so my first thought was to see if Google has a Chatbot API. Turns out, there's a [Hangouts Chatbot API](https://developers.google.com/chat) that can be used for free. Score!





But it's not the only free chatbot API out there - here's a list of [10 chatbot APIs](https://blog.api.rakuten.net/chatbot-apis/) (including Google's)





Now the question is - which ones make it easy (or even possible) to build chatbots in another language?
