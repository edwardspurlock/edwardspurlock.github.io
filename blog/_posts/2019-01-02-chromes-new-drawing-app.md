Since starting to work as a TVC for Google, I've gotten used to using a Chrome OS at work. One thing I've missed is a painting app for quick-and-dirty edits of screenshots and the like. I'm hesitant to search the Chrome browser store every time I want an app that I'm used see bundled into Windows, so mostly I've just taken care of where I carved out my screenshots before sending them to customers.

Well, those of us on the Chrome OS (and anyone who uses the Chrome browser) now have a [quick drawing tool](https://mashable.com/article/chrome-canvas-drawing-app) readily available, according to Mashable.

Canvas can be accessed at [canvas.apps.chrome](https://canvas.apps.chrome/){target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, without downloading an app. It's got the basics - just enough to obscure an account number or other identifying information, or circle the single entry field that needs attention on a form, before forwarding a screenshot to a customer.
