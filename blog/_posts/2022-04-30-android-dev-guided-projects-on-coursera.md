I've been working for Google for 3 1/2 years, but I've never done any Android development.





One of my work development goals this year is to build a mobile app using the Maps SDK for Android. I'm not challenging myself to build an app from scratch, because I'm not that interested in mobile app development. I just intend to build an app and extend it a little bit.





Happily, Coursera.org has a series of short Guided Projects on Android app building. These look like they'll be just what I need to get some understanding of Android app development:





## Projects in Series 1:
