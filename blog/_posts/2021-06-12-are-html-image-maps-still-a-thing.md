Well, they were still a thing as of 2013, apparently. There were even jQuery Responsive Web Design or WordPress [plugins to resize the image map coordinates](https://stackoverflow.com/a/18774108) for different image sizes.









The [Raphael library](http://dmitrybaranovskiy.github.io/raphael/) is an alternative and is still available on Github as of June 12, 2021.
