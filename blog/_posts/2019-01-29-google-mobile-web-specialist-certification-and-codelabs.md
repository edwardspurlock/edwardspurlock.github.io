Well, this looks interesting: [Google Mobile Web Specialist Certification](https://developers.google.com/training/certification/mobile-web-specialist/)





Certification has gotten a bad rap at times, but I think there's still value in pursuing certification. There's no substitute for on-the-job experience with technologies, of course, but the curriculum and certification gives one an idea of the skills and knowledge needed in a subject.





[Google Codelabs](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/?cat=Web) are small projects that provide hands-on experience with various parts of the Google Cloud and other technologies. Some of them look a bit obscure (well, compared to my interests), but a few look like must-sees, like [Your First Progressive Web App](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/your-first-pwapp/index.html) or [YouTube in Your App](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/youtube-in-your-app/index.html).
