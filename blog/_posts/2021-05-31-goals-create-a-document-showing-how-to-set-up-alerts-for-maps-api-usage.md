### Description:





The alerting functions of the Monitoring section of the GCP Console (https://console.cloud.google.com/monitoring/alerting ) can be used to monitor Google Maps APIs. This could be a benefit to Google Maps customers, but this is not supported by GMP technical support. GCP Monitoring and Alerting may be supported by GCP technical support, but most GMP Bronze customers do not have access to GCP support.





To practice my own instructional development and presentation skills, I propose to create a document showing the steps to create alerts for Google Maps APIs, similar to this document (for Geocoding): [How to set and use service level alerts on Google Maps Platform](https://support.woolpert.io/hc/en-us/articles/360045341333-How-to-set-and-use-service-level-alerts-on-Google-Maps-Platform)
