## Rise and shine, campers! It's...BLOG RELAUNCH DAY!!!  
![Well, it's Groundhog Day...again.](/assets/images/GroundhogDayAgain.png)  

As I noted in the introduction on the blog landing page, I've been blogging for years using WordPress. In fact, this isn't the first time I've relaunched my WordPress blog. I originally started a blog focused on web design in 2011. I created more than 90 posts in 2011 and 2012, then decided to move my blog to a new hosting provider. I backed up the existing posts to XML files on my local hard drive, then created a new WordPress blog in late 2013 and started blogging. I meant to migrate the backed up posts to the new blog, but never got around to it.

I've been updating this site for several weeks since mid-December 2023. I originally hoped to have the site ready to relaunch on January 1. As January 1 came and went, I thought I would postdate this post to January 1, making it look like I had it ready on time. A couple of days ago, I realized that relaunching in early February would be more honest - better still, it gives me an excuse to reference one of my favorite movies!  

## Why the relaunch?
In the past couple of years, I've realized I want to change my career to data analysis or data engineering. Last year, I went through the Google Data Analytics Certificate curriculum and some other related courses on Coursera.  

Over the summer, I learned about the Data Science 1-year certificate curriculum at Austin Community College. I enrolled at ACC for the Fall 2023 semester and took the first four classes in the Data Science curriculum - Programming Fundamentals with Python, Scientific Python, Database Programming with SQL, and Spreadsheets using Excel. I earned a grade of 4.0 in all 4 classes, but I couldn't afford to enroll for more classes in the Spring semester.

I wanted to create a portfolio of projects to demonstrate my new SQL and Python skills. I thought about creating project writeups as WordPress pages on my existing blog site, but I couldn't find a good WordPress theme that would allow me to customize the site structure and design the way I liked.  

I thought about building a dynamic website using a Python framework like Django or Flask, or creating a dynamic site using React. However, I wanted to get the site up and running as soon as possible, and I knew that creating a dynamic site from scratch would take a lot of time away from my career pivot.  

I knew that static website blogs are a good alternative to WordPress. I researched static site frameworks, and after playing with a Python framework, I settled on Jekyll, hosted on Github Pages. Although Jekyll is built on Ruby instead of Python, the two languages are similar enough that I can make changes to the site structure and design easily. Also, Jekyll is very mature, and there are a lot of tutorials available for new users.  

It took longer than I wanted back in December, but I've gotten the site to look the way I like, migrated posts from my WordPress blog, and completed some project writeups, so it's time to go live!
