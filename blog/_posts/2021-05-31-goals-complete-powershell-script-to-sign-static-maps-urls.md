### Description:





Complete a PowerShell script to sign Static Maps URLs (using a secret signing key copied from the GCP Console). The script will be usable as a function to sign URLs in other PowerShell scripts, or also be able to accept URLs as strings in a command line pipeline.After completing the script and accompanying documentation, I will complete a project one-pager to have the script added to the existing Github repository of Static Maps signing tools (at <http://googlemaps.github.io/url-signing/index.html> )
