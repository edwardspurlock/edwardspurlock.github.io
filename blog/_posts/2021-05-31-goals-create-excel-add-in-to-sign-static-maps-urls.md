### Description:





Adapt the existing C# code at <https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/maps-static/get-api-key#sample-code-for-url-signing> to be used as an open source add-in for Microsoft Excel.





After completing the development and testing of the plugin, I will create a project one-pager to request the add-in to be added to the URL signing samples Github repo (at <http://googlemaps.github.io/url-signing/index.html> )
