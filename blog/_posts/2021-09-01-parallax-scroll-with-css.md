My first portfolio project will be FreeCodeCamp's "Tribute page", the first project in their beginner Responsive Web Design track.





It's a fairly simple web page, and it would be pretty easy to create a minimal solution that fulfills all the requirements. But if I'm going to add it to my portfolio, I want something at least a little better than the minimum, so I've been thinking about ways to improve the look of the page.





Parallax scrolling is where two or more elements on a web page move at different speeds when the page is scrolled (vertically or horizontally). It's a little gimmicky, I suppose, but I think it will work for this project.





The Google Web Developers December 2016 Updates (blog) had an article titled Performant Parallaxing that explained how to implement [parallax scrolling using CSS that works cross-browser](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2016/12/performant-parallaxing).





It looks like it should be pretty simple to add to my first portfolio project. And since I currently work for Google and plan to use Google Maps Platform examples in my later portfolio works, using their parallax scrolling solution for a non-Google portfolio project seems appropriate. However, the article was written in 2016, so it may require changes to work with current browsers.
